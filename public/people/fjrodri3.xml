        <bio>&lt;p&gt;Fernando Rodríguez is a Ph.D. candidate in Human-Centered Computing advised by Dr. Kristy Elizabeth Boyer. His research interests include computer science education and collaborative learning. He was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship for his research on how undergraduate students with little prior programming experience use pair programming to complete problem-solving activities and how we can best support these students during this collaboration.  Currently, Fernando is part of the CS-CLIMATE project, developing collaboration support interventions for introductory computer science education.&lt;/p&gt;
		
		<!--&lt;p&gt;For the Conversational UX Design workshop held at CHI 2017, Fernando authored a position paper on how students collaborate in computer science problem solving and how to design dialogue agents that can support these students: &lt;a href='https://cise.ufl.edu/research/learndialogue/pdf/LearnDialogue-Rodriguez-CHI-ConversationalUXWorkshop-2017.pdf' &gt;Toward Conversational Agents that Support Learning: A Look at Human Collaborations in Computer Science Problem Solving&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;-->
