<!--HOW TO WRITE YOUR BIO: 

You can play with the order of this info a bit but you should include all of this information. THIRD PERSON is not optional.

0. Write in third person.

1. Say what program you're in at UF, who your advisor is, what degrees you already have and where you got them. 

2. If you're being funded by a prestigious fellowship or scholarship, like the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, you can list that too. 

3. Characterize your relevant background/skill set (maybe you worked as a teacher, a software engineer, or had done previous research). 

4. State your research focus over the past semester/year - if you're new to the group, talk to your mentor/project teammates about what might be good to put here or check out their bios for inspiration.

5. Go back and make sure it's ALL in third person!-->
